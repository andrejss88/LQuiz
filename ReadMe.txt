#LQuiz

A Bootstrap + jQuery based Quiz. This is a spare-time project, hence code is not perfect nor fully refactored. 

Note!
The answers are in the HTML on purpose so that the Quiz can be run locally (but answers are visible to anybody with sufficient knowledge of the browser).

Types of exercises include:

1) Matching
2) Fill in the box
3) Multiple choice
4) Rearrange words

Features included possible to tweak or turn on/off:
1) Compare current score to the previous one
2) Race against time
3) Setting time per each exercise
4) Evaluate entire quiz or each exercise separately
5) Generates and appends buttons with special characters (é,ç, etc.) to the fields where input is necessary.
